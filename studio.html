                    <p>The modern drum machine with the DNA of legendary TRs. 6 tracks with classic 808, 909, 707 sounds and custom samples. Scatter effects are perfect for creating explosive fills during live performances. Compactness doesn't compromise power: this is the groove driver for devastating techno kicks.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="device">
                    <h4>Roland MC-101</h4>
                    <p>Pocket-sized groovebox with the ZEN-Core Series sound engine. 4 tracks for synths, drums, and basslines. Perfect for quick idea sketches or as an ambient texture generator during sets. The step sequencer with motion recording captures every nuance of performances.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="device">
                    <h4>Roland MX-1 Mix Performer</h4>
                    <p>The command center of the setup. 18 channels, effects for each track, and perfect integration with the AIRA ecosystem. During live shows, the MX-1 transforms mixing into performance: filter sweeps, real-time sidechain, and instant scene switching. The effects section is an infinite creative playground.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="device">
                    <h4>Roland MC-307</h4>
                    <p>Vintage groovebox from the '90s, the sound of early raves. 8 tracks with ROMpler sounds that define old-school techno aesthetics. The presets are dated but that's precisely what makes them authentic. Used mainly for atmospheric pads and those subby basslines typical of '96-'98.</p>

                    <h4>Yamaha RM1X</h4>
                    <p>The legend of 2000s grooveboxes. Incredibly deep hardware sequencer with complex arpeggiators and pattern chains. The sounds aren't the best, but the sequencer is unbeatable for creating organically evolving grooves. Used mainly as a MIDI brain to control other synths with patterns impossible to program manually.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="device">
                    <h4>Arturia MicroFreak</h4>
                    <p>Hybrid digital-analog synth with capacitive keyboard. 12 different synthesis engines ranging from wavetable to granular. The modulation matrix makes it unpredictable and perfect for acid leads and experimental textures. The integrated sequencer with arpeggiator creates hypnotic patterns that evolve for minutes.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="device">
                    <h4>Behringer TD-3</h4>
                    <p>Clone of the legendary TB-303. Acid basslines that define the techno sound. The resonant filter in self-oscillation creates those squelches that shake club walls. Programming via old-school step sequencer, where mistakes often become the best parts of the track.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="device">
                    <h4>Behringer Edge</h4>
                    <p>Semi-modular synth inspired by the ARP 2600. Brutal oscillators perfect for sub-frequency bass you feel in your chest. Filter tracking and ring modulator add that industrial aggression. Internal patchbay allows creative routing without external cables.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="device">
                    <h4>Korg Volca Keys</h4>
                    <p>Mini analog synth with 3 oscillators. Warm and fat sound despite its small size. Perfect for chord stabs and ambient pads. The loop sequencer is fantastic for creating melodic ostinatos that add movement to the most minimal tracks. Integrated delay essential for spatial textures.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="device">
                    <h4>Behringer RD-9</h4>
                    <p>The accessible 909. Every drum voice is analog and sounds massive. Kick with devastating punch, snare that cuts through any mix, hi-hat with that perfect metallic sizzle. The sequencer is simple but effective, and the probability function per step adds organic variations to patterns. This is the foundation of the techno beat.</p>

                <div class="device">
                    <h4>Roland Torcido (AIRA Compact)</h4>
                    <p>Distortion and modulation in super compact format. I mainly use it to dirty up kicks and basslines that are too clean. The bit crusher adds that lo-fi character, while the valve distortion warms up digital sounds. Essential for adding grit and character to overly sterile sounds.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="device">
                    <h4>Korg Monotron Delay</h4>
                    <p>Mini synth with incredible analog delay. The MS-20 style filter adds wild resonance, while the BBD delay creates those warm, degrading repetitions typical of analog. Perfect for dub techno vibes and adding spatial depth to any signal. The ribbon controller is fantastic for extreme pitch bending during performances.</p>

            <div class="studio-section signal">
                <h3><span>🔌</span> Signal Flow</h3>
                <div class="device">
                    <p><strong>Audio Routing:</strong> Everything converges on the Roland MX-1 mixer, which acts as the central hub for the 8 main channels. Additional machines are managed through sub-mixing and then sent to the MX-1. The master signal goes to the Behringer UMC1820 interface, which captures 8 stereo tracks simultaneously for multi-track recordings.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="device">
                    <p><strong>Patchbay System:</strong> A patchbay allows flexible routing without constantly disconnecting and reconnecting cables. Each machine has its normalized outputs, but with simple patch cables I can re-route any signal through external effects, create send/return loops, or send audio between different machines for cross-processing.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="device">
                    <p><strong>MIDI Routing:</strong> The MPC Live is the master clock that synchronizes everything via MIDI. Through a MIDI thru box, the clock is distributed to all machines maintaining perfect sync. This allows completely hardware jam sessions where every machine plays in lock, ready to be recorded at any moment.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="device">
                    <p><strong>Behringer UMC1820:</strong> 8-in/8-out audio interface that acts as a bridge between the analog world and the DAW. It allows recording separate stems while maintaining the hardware workflow, but having the flexibility of in-the-box mixing and mastering. The preamps are clean and transparent, they don't color the sound of the machines.</p>
                </div>

            <div class="studio-section philosophy">
                <h3>Production Philosophy</h3>
                <div class="device">
                    <p>My approach is 100% hardware-based. No DAW during the creative phase - just machines, cables, and pure electric inspiration. Every session starts with an improvised jam where I let the machines "talk to each other." Mistakes become features, glitches become grooves.</p>
                    <p style="margin-top: 15px;">The setup is designed for live performance as much as for studio production. Every control is within reach, every machine can be manipulated in real-time. The result is tracks that breathe, that have dynamics and human imperfections - everything that's missing from music produced entirely in-the-box.</p>
                    <p style="margin-top: 15px;">Techno is born from physical interaction with machines, from the tactile feel of knobs, from the immediate response of pads. This setup represents that visceral relationship with sound that makes each track unique and impossible to replicate exactly - just as electronic music should be.</p>
