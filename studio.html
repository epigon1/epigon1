                <h3><span>🔌</span> Signal Flow</h3>
                <div class="device">
                    <p><strong>Audio Routing:</strong> Everything converges on the Roland MX-1 mixer, which acts as the central hub for the 8 main channels. Additional machines are managed through sub-mixing and then sent to the MX-1. The master signal goes to the Behringer UMC1820 interface, which captures 8 stereo tracks simultaneously for multi-track recordings.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="device">
                    <p><strong>Patchbay System:</strong> A patchbay allows flexible routing without constantly disconnecting and reconnecting cables. Each machine has its normalized outputs, but with simple patch cables I can re-route any signal through external effects, create send/return loops, or send audio between different machines for cross-processing.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="device">
                    <p><strong>MIDI Routing:</strong> The MPC Live is the master clock that synchronizes everything via MIDI. Through a MIDI thru box, the clock is distributed to all machines maintaining perfect sync. This allows completely hardware jam sessions where every machine plays in lock, ready to be recorded at any moment.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="device">
                    <p><strong>Behringer UMC1820:</strong> 8-in/8-out audio interface that acts as a bridge between the analog world and the DAW. It allows recording separate stems while maintaining the hardware workflow, but having the flexibility of in-the-box mixing and mastering. The preamps are clean and transparent, they don't color the sound of the machines.</p>

            <div class="studio-section philosophy">
                <h3>Production Philosophy</h3>
                <div class="device">
                    <p>My approach is 100% hardware-based. No DAW during the creative phase - just machines, cables, and pure electric inspiration. Every session starts with an improvised jam where I let the machines "talk to each other." Mistakes become features, glitches become grooves.</p>
                    <p style="margin-top: 15px;">The setup is designed for live performance as much as for studio production. Every control is within reach, every machine can be manipulated in real-time. The result is tracks that breathe, that have dynamics and human imperfections - everything that's missing from music produced entirely in-the-box.</p>
                    <p style="margin-top: 15px;">Techno is born from physical interaction with machines, from the tactile feel of knobs, from the immediate response of pads. This setup represents that visceral relationship with sound that makes each track unique and impossible to replicate exactly - just as electronic music should be.</p>
